### Description

Tell us what happens.

### Environment

1. Brunch:
2. Node:
3. NPM:
4. Operating system:

### `package.json` contents

### brunch config contents

### Other useful files, when present (`bower.json` etc.)

If there's an unexpected error during `brunch build`/`brunch watch`, please attach the compilation log with the debug flag (`-d`).

If something worked with previous versions of brunch, but stopped with a newer one, please include these details as well.

Finally, if at all possible, please create a small demo app on GitHub that demonstrates the issue so it's easier for us to check and debug.
