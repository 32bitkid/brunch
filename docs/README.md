# Brunch docs

Brunch is an assembler for HTML5 applications. It's agnostic to frameworks, libraries, programming, stylesheet & templating languages and backend technology.

To simplify app development, brunch watches your files for changes and automatically wraps your scripts and templates in common.js modules. All build errors are printed to console. If you have growl / libnotify, brunch will use them too.

See official site for more information about the tool http://brunch.io.
