Skeletons
*********

Brunch uses skeletons to provide pre-defined application structure.

Main parts of every skeleton:

* App path (usually `app/`): place for user's code should be.
* Vendor path (usually `vendor/`): place for 3rd party libs should be.
* Config (usually `config.coffee`): defines application configuration
* Test path (usually `test/`): place for tests.
